### Overview
This is built with [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), and is my attempt to using the Cherry MX ULP switches. Documentation and availability of these switches is _severely_ lacking, so I make no promises that this works, will always work, or is in any way the best way to do this.

If you see something that can be improved, please feel free to open a PR!

### What's Next?
To see what I have planned next, need to tackle, or just curious where this project is going, check out the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), or open [Issues](https://github.com/nshirley/ergogen-tapioca/issues)!

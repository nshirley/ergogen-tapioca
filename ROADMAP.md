## Major Milestones 🚀

1. **First Prototype**
   - Description: The best way to see if it works is to just try it! 
   - Dependencies: Unknown

2. **ZMK Firmware**
   - Description: Next logical step, need to add ZMK firmware mapping for (my) preferred layout.
   - Dependencies: First Prototype
   - Estimated Completion: [Early January 2025].

## Minor Enhancements 🌟

1. **MX ULP Footprint Reversible**

   - Dependencies: Unknown.
   - Estimated Completion: [Early December 2024].

## Tweaks and Bug Fixes 🛠️

1. **[Task Name]**
